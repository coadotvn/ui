  h1 Visibility Classes
  h3 Visibility classes let you show or hide elements based on screen size or device orientation. You can use visibility classes to control which elements users see depending on their browsing environment.
  hr

  h2 Show by Screen Size
  p In this example, we use the show visibility classes to 
    strong show 
    | certain strings of text based on the device on which users view a page. If their browser meets the class's conditions, the element will be shown. If not, it will be hidden.

      p.mb-5.sfxxlu This text is shown on xxlarge screens and up.
  hr

  h2 Hide by Screen Size
  p This example shows the opposite: It uses the 
    strong hide 
    | visibility classes to state which elements should disappear based on your device's screen size or orientation. Users will see elements on every browser except those that meet these conditions.

  h2 Orientation Detection
  p This straightforward example shows how two strings of text determine whether or not an element is visible in different orientations. This will change on mobile devices when you rotate the device. On desktop, the orientation is almost always reported as landscape.

      pre
        code(data-language="html").
          <p class="sfls">You are in landscape orientation.</p>
          <p class="sfpt">You are in portrait orientation.</p>
    .cl.md-6
      h4 Rendered HTML
      p.mb-5.sfls You are in landscape orientation.
      p.mb-5.sfpt You are in portrait orientation.
  hr

  h2 Touch Detection
  p There are also visibility classes to hide or show content based on whether a device supports touch (as determined by Modernizr).
  .rw
    .cl.md-6
      h4 HTML
      pre
        code(data-language="html").
          <p class="sft">You are on a touch-enabled device.</p>
          <p class="hft">You are not on a touch-enabled device.</p>
    .cl.md-6
      h4 Rendered HTML
      p.mb-5.sfls You are in landscape orientation.
      p.mb-5.sfpt You are in portrait orientation.
  hr

  h2 Accessibility
  p Finally, if you want to hide some content but still make it accessible for screen readers, use the hidden visibility classes. Do not confuse these classes with hide visibility classes. Use these classes in conjunction with the hide and show visibility classes to control complex layouts while offering accessibility for those using screen readers.
  hr

  h2 Print Styles
  p gia.ui includes print styles developed by HTML5 Boilerplate to give you some basic print-specific styles. These are activated when you print through a media query. It includes:
  ul.d
    li Clearing out backgrounds, box shadows and text shadows
    li Appending link URLs after the anchor text
    li Bordering blockquotes and pre elements
    li Page cleanup and window minimization
  o On top of that, gia.ui includes a couple of simple classes you can use to control elements printing, or not printing. Simply attach
  span.class .sfp
  | to an element to only show when printing, and
  span.class .hfp
  | to hide something when printing.

  h3 Available classes:
  ul.d
    li
      span.class .sfp
      | ,
      span.class .po
      | (Visable for printing)
    li
      span.class .hfp
      | ,
      span.class .hop
      | (Hidden while printing)
  hr

  h2 Customize with Stylus
  p Customizing the visibility classes is easy with the Stylus variables provided in the
    span.class settings/visibility.styl
    | file.
  h4 Stylus
  pre
    code(data-language="stylus")
      include css/ui/_components/visibility.settings.styl
  hr

  h3 Stylus Errors?
  p Make sure you import this line in main file:
  h4 Stylus
  pre
    code(data-language="css").
      @import '_components/visibility'
